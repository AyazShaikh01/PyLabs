# WHO AM I?

I’m Ayaz Shaikh — a Computer Engineering student, currently in my 7th semester.

**No real skills yet. No achievements. No contributions.**  
Just a **DELULU STUDENT** thinking he can WIN... @_@

This is the start of a new journey — one focused on **learning**, **growing**, and (hopefully) becoming consistent.  
Let’s see how long I can stay disciplined...

And when this **DELULU BUBBLE POPS**. 😵‍💫

Started this repo in the hope of fixing the mess I’ve made up until now...

Am I delusional? **YES YESS YESSS**.
Thinking I can be better before graduation? **YES YESS YESS**.  


# (=_=) Depression  KILLS. Delusional is SURVIVAL. Stay DELULU ($_$).
 > When reality weighs heavy, delusion keeps the soul light.
