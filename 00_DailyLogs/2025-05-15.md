# DAY 2 -> 15th May 2025

Hey There!! 
    Its Day 2, and i showed up...
    well it's easy at the starting days but harder as time goes, but yeah - i am exicted to see where things go. either i will continue this, or might just end up ending it abruptly in the middle due to inconsistency... but i can't just sit there and speculate things.

so, lets start with the learning instead of just giving out the Philosophical knowledge...

## SO, 
I started with python yesterday, but it was just a brief about the language rather than learning it.
so, right now i am figuring out what to start with. I mean yeah i know about datatype, variables, loops, controls etc... but what to truely follow to implement something - cause i started this repo to see what i can build not what i just learn.

> see what i am doing in 01_basics/, i was trying to learn things first, but then ended up documenting there...
